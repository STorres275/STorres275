Hi, and welcome to my profile. I’m Sérgio Torres. 😁  

Since I was young, computers and technology have caught my attention in general, but it was only in a short robotics course at college that I was introduced to the world of programming.
#### I was hooked from that moment on. 🪝  

After a journey as a project manager in the food industry 🏭, I finally decided to answer the call and make a fundamental change to become a programmer 🧑‍💻.
With this in mind, I joined the <A/C> bootcamp 🪖 where I was provided with a set of essential tools and skills to become a junior fullstack developer!   

Tech Stack:  
- Java  
- JavaScript  
- SQL  
- HTML  
- CSS  

FrameWorks:  
- Bootstrap  
- Spring MVC  
- Spring Boot  
- Hibernate  
- JUnit  
- Mockito  

🌱 I’m currently learning React so I can deepen my skills in JS.
